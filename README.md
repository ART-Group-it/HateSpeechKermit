## What about _KERM-HATE_
In this GitHub we present _KERM-HATE_ : a hate speech recognizer that exploits syntax to highlight the key points that triggered that particular class to the given sentence.
An example, present [in our paper](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-859/), is the following:

## Model architecture

## Datasets
The _Datasets_ folder includes:
- The [Davidson dataset](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14955)
- The _Election_datasets.zip_ : a corpus heavily used within our paper and generated by Manch Hui in his [Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/manchunhui/us-election-2020-tweets/metadata).
In detail, the .zip file consists of:
  - Democratic dataset
  - GOP dataset
