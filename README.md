## What about _KERM-HATE_
In this GitHub we present _KERM-HATE_ : a hate speech recognizer that exploits syntax to highlight, given a sentence, the key points that triggered the classification in a certain class.
_KERM-HATE_ exploits _BERT trasnformer model_ for sequence classification flanked by a KERMIT component.
An example of our output - present [in our paper](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-859/) - is the following:

## Model architecture

## Available datasets and generated datasets
The _Datasets_ folder includes:
1. The [Davidson dataset](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14955)
2. The _Election_datasets.zip_ : a corpus heavily used within our paper and generated by Manch Hui in his [Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/manchunhui/us-election-2020-tweets/metadata). In detail, the .zip file consists of:
      - Democratic dataset
      - GOP dataset
3. The _InstagramChromeDriver.ipynb_ is a jupyter notebook to is an easy tool to convert Instagram public-posts into pandas dataframes using ChromeDriver. To learn more about it go to its dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/itsmattei/Catch-Instagram-post-comments).

## Usability   
This GitHub repository is divided into the following files and folders:
```bash
Kermit as hate speech recognizer.ipynb          <-- KERM-HATE model and how to train and use it
Datasets
├── Davidson_dataset.csv                        <-- the original Davidson dataset 
├── Election_datasets.zip                       <-- zip file contains the Democratic and the GOP dataset
├── InstagramChromeDriver.ipynb                 <-- Scaprer Instagram comments
```
To visualize the activation trees, we use the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ART-Group-it/KERMIT) of the basic version of KERMIT
